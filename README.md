#### Evento | TicketMaster App

This app retrieves events from the TicketMaster Api and offers users the ability to buy tickets on the website, or save a list of their favorite events in the app.

### What went well
The app looks pretty good for being done in under a week.

###What was difficult
The TicketMaster Api is pretty complicated and was confusing to work with at first in terms of making the retrofit call and adding the heavily nested data into the database.
But we perservered and it ended up working out well.
